#MathBackground 
### Definition:
- A subgroup is a subset of a [Group](Group.md) that is itself a group under the same operation as the larger group.
### Usage in Cryptography:
- Subgroups are particularly important in the construction of cryptographic protocols, where smaller subgroups with hard-to-solve problems (like the Discrete Logarithm Problem([DL](DL))) are used.
