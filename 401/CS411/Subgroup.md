### Definition:
- A subgroup is a subset of a [Group](Group.md) that is itself a group under the same operation as the larger group.
- **Lagrange Theorem:
	- The order of a subgroup divides the order of the group
	- Example:
		- $Z_p^* = {1,2 \dots,10}$ where $|Z_{11}^*| = 10$ 
		- $H = {1,3,4,5,9}$ where $|H| = 5$
		- Since order of H divides order of $Z_{11}^*$ H is subgroup of Z
		- Otherwise it was not a subgroup
