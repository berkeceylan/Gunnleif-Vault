#MathBackground 
### Defintion:
- Based on [[GCD]]
### Theorem: 
- If $gcd(a, n) = 1$, then $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n$ where $\phi$ is Euler's totient function.
- $\large a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n$
### Euler Totient Function
- Counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n.
- shown as $\large \phi(n)$

### Usage in Cryptography:
- Euler's theorem is used in the [[RSA]] encryption algorithm and in general for working with cyclic groups in cryptography.
