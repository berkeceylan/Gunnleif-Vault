#MathBackground 
### Definition: 
- A number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself. 
- Prime numbers are the building blocks of the number system.
### Prime Number Theory
- **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**:
	- Every integer greater than 1 either is a prime number itself or can be factorized uniquely into prime numbers up to order.
	- Every integer $> 1 = p_1^{k_1} \cdot p_2^{k_2} \cdot ... \cdot p_n^{k_n}$
### Usage in Cryptography:
- Prime numbers are essential in [[Asymmetric Key Cipher]], such as [[RSA]], where the security of the encryption relies on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.
