#### Authentication with Encryption:
- **Use of Ciphertext**: 
	- The ciphertext of a message can serve as an authenticator. If it decrypts into meaningful plaintext, the message is considered authentic.
- **Limitations**: 
	- May be challenging to distinguish a meaningful message.
	- Not suitable for selective authentication.
	- One party may be interested in authentication, while others require confidentiality.
	- Separation of authentication and confidentiality offers flexibility
