### Definition: 
- Encryption techniques that were used historically before the advent of modern [cryptographic](Cryptography.md) methods. 
- Most of them based on [Substitution Cipher](Substitution%20Cipher.md) method
- They typically involve simple forms of substitution or transposition of characters in the plaintext to create ciphertext.
### Examples:
- **[Caesar Cipher](Caesar%20Cipher.md)**: 
	- Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
-  **[Affine Cipher](Affine%20Cipher.md)**: 
	- Encrypts letters using a mathematical function involving modular arithmetic with two keys
- **[Vigenere Cipher](Vigenere%20Cipher.md)**: 
	- Uses a keyword to provide a sequence of Caesar shifts
