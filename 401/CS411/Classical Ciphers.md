### Definition: 
- Encryption techniques that were used historically before the advent of modern [[Cryptography |cryptographic]] methods. 
- Most of them based on [[Substitution Cipher]] method
- They typically involve simple forms of substitution or transposition of characters in the plaintext to create ciphertext.
### Examples:
- **[[Caesar Cipher]]**: 
	- Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
-  **[[Affine Cipher]]**: 
	- Encrypts letters using a mathematical function involving modular arithmetic with two keys
- **[[Vigenere Cipher]]**: 
	- Uses a keyword to provide a sequence of Caesar shifts
