### Terminology
- **Cryptology**
    - Cryptography
        - The process of designing/constructing/implementing cryptographic systems
    - Cryptanalysis
        - The discipline of breaking the cryptographic systems
        - Brute force (or exhaustive search) is the last resort 
- **Adversary**
    - Passive
        - Read the message
        - Figure out the decryption key and read all messages encrypted with this key 
    - Active
        - Modify the content of message
        - impersonate the receiver/sender (act like you are the one of them)
### Main Objectives of Cryptography
- **Confidentially**
    - Hiding contents of messages exchanged in a transaction 
- **Authentication**
    - The origin (owner) of a message is correctly identified 
- **Integrity**
    - Only authorized parties are able to modify data and transmitted information 
- **Non-repudiation**
    - neither sender or receiver of a message cannot later deny having sent or received the
