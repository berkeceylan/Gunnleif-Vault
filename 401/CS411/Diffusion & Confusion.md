## Diffusion:
- Changing one letter in plaintext result in changes in several letters of the cipher text
- Local changes in the plaintext result in global changes in the ciphertext
## Confusion:
- To make the relationship between the ciphertext and the key as complex as possible
	- Additional obscurity between plain and cipher text
- Ensures that an attacker cannot predict how a change in the key will affect the ciphertext
- The key should not relate to the ciphertext in a simple way.
