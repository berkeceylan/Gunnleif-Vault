## Ring in Cryptography

### Definition:
- A Ring in cryptography refers to a structure used in digital signature schemes ([PKC](PKC.md)). 
- It allows any member of a group to produce a signature on behalf of the group without revealing the specific member who signed the message.
### Characteristics:
- **Anonymity in Group Signature**:
	  - The ring signature scheme provides anonymity, enabling any group member to sign messages, keeping the signer's identity confidential within the group.
- **Computational Infeasibility**:
	  - It is computationally infeasible to determine which member of the group created a given signature, enhancing the security of the scheme.
### Modulo Operations in Ring:
- Rings in cryptography often involve modulo arithmetic, which is fundamental to many operations in PKC. Key properties include:
  - **Operation (+)**:
	- **Additive Identity**:  $a + 0 = a \quad \text{where } a \in \mathbb{Z}_m$
	- **Additive Inverse**: $-a = m - a \text{ such that } a + (-a) \equiv 0 \mod m$ 
	- **Closed Under Addition**: $\text{If } a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_m \text{ then } a + b \in \mathbb{Z}_m$
	- **Commutative**: $a + b = b + a$
	- **Associative**: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
  - **Operation (Ã—)**:
	- **Multiplicative Identity**: $a \times 1 \equiv a \mod m$
	- **Multiplicative Inverse**: $\text{If } \gcd(a, m) = 1 \text{ and denoted as } a^{-1} \text{ such that } a^{-1} \times a \equiv 1 \mod m$
	- **Closed Under Multiplication**: $\text{If } a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_m \text{ then } a \times b \in \mathbb{Z}_m$
	- **Commutative**: $a \times b = b \times a$
	- **Associative**: $(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)$
### Importance in Modern PKC:
- The ring $Z_m$ and its arithmetic are of central importance in modern PKC 
    - the order of integers involved in PKC = $2^{160}, 2^{4096}$
