### Definition:
- Kerchkoff's Principle assumes that the complete details of the [[Cryptography |cryptographic]] algorithm are known to the public.
- Emphasizing transparency in the algorithm and reliability in key management.
- Secrecy of the cryptographic algorithm is not important
### Properties:
 - **Algorithm Quality**: 
	 - Security of the system should be based on quality of the algorithm and key space
	 - Not secrecy
- **Sufficiently Large Key Space**: 
	- The key space, or the range of possible keys, should be large enough to resist brute force attacks.
- Larger key size do not improve the security necessarily
	- Larger than 100 bit is not necessary since its beyond our computational power in today
	- >>> 100bit only increase the cost of creating and processing of the key
