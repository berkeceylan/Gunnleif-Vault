### Berlekamp-Massey Algorithm (BMA)

### Definition:
- Is an algorithm used for efficiently determining the shortest [LFSR](LFSR.md) sequence capable of generating a given binary sequence. 
	- We call this [Linear Complexity](Linear%20Complexity.md), denoted as $L(s_n)$
- It's a key tool in the analysis and synthesis of LFSRs.
### Usage:
- **[LFSR](LFSR.md) Synthesis and Analysis**:
	- Used to find the minimal polynomial and the least number of taps(the degree of the feedback polynomial) required for an LFSR to produce a given finite sequence.
	- Determine the linear complexity of a finite binary sequence
		- Expected linear complexity of a random sequence:  $\large E(L(s^n)) \approx \frac{n}{2} + \frac{2}{9}$
	- It provides an efficient method to determine the LFSR parameters
- **[Stream Cipher](Stream%20Cipher.md)**:
   - Helps to analyze LSFR sequences created in Stream Cipher
	   - understanding their complexity and period
   - Can be used as a attack method to decrypt Stream Cipher
   - BMA can determine the LFSR configuration from a segment of the output sequence, an attacker can potentially predict future bits in the sequence
	   - Can attack only single LSFR
