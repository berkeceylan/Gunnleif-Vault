### Definition:
- DL is the underlying hard problem for:
	- [Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange](Diffie-Hellman%20Key%20Exchange.md)
	- [Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)](Digital%20Signature%20Algorithm%20(DSA).md)
	- [ElGamal](ElGamal.md)
	- [Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)](Elliptic%20Curve%20Cryptography%20(ECC).md)
- DL is defined over finite [Group](Group.md)s
- **Problem Definition:**
	- Let p be a prime and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be nonzero integers in $Z_p$ and suppose.
		- $\beta = \alpha^x \mod p$ 
		- The problem finding x is called discrete logarithm problem
