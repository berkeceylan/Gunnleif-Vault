#MathBackground 
### Definition:
- Gauss' Algorithm is a method for finding solutions to systems of linear congruences. 
- Gauss' Algorithm could assist in manipulating the equations to a form where [[CRT]] can be applied

### Usage in Cryptography:
- It can be used to solve linear congruences in cryptosystems, such as those involved in [[RSA]] during key generation and decryption.
- It's particularly useful when dealing with the Chinese Remainder Theorem([[CRT]]).
