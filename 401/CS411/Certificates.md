- There are different types of certificates
	- Identity certificates 
		- contains entity’s identity information such as e-mail address, and a list of public keys for the entity

- Data in certificates is signed by the CA
	- If Alice knows the public key of the CA
	- she can extract with assurance Bob’s identity +public keys from his certificate
- More trusted CA can certify less trusted CA
- **Types:**
	- [[X.509 Certificates]]
### Revocation:
- Certificates expire (intentionally) because:
	- The user’s private key is (suspected to be) compromised
	- The user is no longer certified by this CA
	- The CA’s certificate is (suspected to be) compromised
- Along with the certificates, certificate revocation list (CRL) is posted to the directory
- CRL is signed by the issuer
- When a user receives a certificate, it also checks the CRL to see if the certificate is still valid
- Methods:
	- [[Certificate Revocation List (CRL)]]
	- [[Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)]]
