### Definition:
- Digital signatures enable us to personalize electronic documents
- A digital signature is not only tied to the signer but also to the message that is being signed
- Digital signatures must be easily verified by the others
- Two Parts:
	- Signature Generation
	- Signature Verification
### DSA Algorithm:
- NIST proposed the DSA in 1991 and adopted it as a standard in 1993
- Similar to the [ElGamal](ElGamal.md) method
- Example of DSA implementation [ECDSA](Attachments/ECDSA.png) and [RSA Signatures](RSA%20Signatures.md)
- It uses a hash value (message digest) that is signed
	- [SHA-1](SHA-1.md) and [SHA-2](SHA-2.md) can be used to hash messages
- **Setup:**
	- Signer
		- find a prime q = 156 bits long 
		- chooses a prime p = 3071 bits long which satisfy $q|p-1$
		- choose a secret value $a: 1< a < q-1$
		- calculates: $\beta = g^a \mod p$
	- g = primitive root in group $G_p$
		- must generate every element in the group
	- $\alpha$ random number in$\mod p$
		- $g = \alpha^{(p-1/q)} \mod p$
		- if $g = 1$ choose a new $\alpha$
		- if $g \neq 1$ use that $\alpha$ 
	- Publish: $\{p,q,g,\beta\}$ and keep $\{a\}$ secret
- **Signature Scheme:**
	- m = massage
	- Compute h = H(m)
		- hash the message and get its hash value as 'h'
	- Select random integer $k: 1< k < q$
	- Compute: $r = (g^k \mod p)(\mod q)$
	- Compute: $s = k^{-1}(h+ar)(\mod q)$
	- Signature for m = $(r,s)$
	- Send $(r,s)$ and $m$ to Verifier to verify
- **Verification Scheme:**
	- Verifier knows:  $\{p,q,g,\beta\}$ and $(r,s)$ and $m$
	- Compute h = H(m)
	- Compute: $u_1 = s^{-1}h \mod q$
	- Compute: $u_2 =s^{-1}r \mod q$
	- Compute $v = (g^{u_1}\beta^{u_2} \mod p) \mod q$
		- If v = r accept
		- Otherwise not accept
### Security:
- [Birthday Attack](Birthday%20Attack.md) can be used to break hashes so sufficient bit lengths must be used.
- For example case pf this attack implementation look at the slide Digital Signatures page 14-16
