### Definition:
- Generated in a manner that is fundamentally unpredictable and not determined by any prior process or value.
### Creation:
- **Hardware Based Creation**:
	- Utilizes inherent unpredictability in physical processes such as electronic noise or radioactive decay.
- **Quantum Random Number Generator**:
	- Exploits the inherent unpredictability of quantum phenomena, like the behavior of photons.
### Examples:
- Radioactive decay-based generators
- Electronic noise-based generators 
- Photonic quantum setups
