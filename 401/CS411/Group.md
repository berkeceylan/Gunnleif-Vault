#MathBackground 
### Definition:
- A group is a set equipped with 
	- an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element 
	- while satisfying four conditions: 
		- closure
		- associativity
		- the identity element
		- inverse element
- $Z_p^* = {1,2\dots,p-1}$ 
	- Operation is the modular multiplication with prime p
	- Order of $|Z_p^*|= p-1$
- [Primitive (Root) Elements](Primitive%20(Root)%20Elements.md) are used to generate all nonzero elements in a group.
- [Subgroup](Subgroup.md) is the group that divides the order of supergroup
### Usage in Cryptography:
- Groups provide the mathematical framework for many cryptographic systems
