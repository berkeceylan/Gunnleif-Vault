#MathBackground 
### Definition:
- A group is a set equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element while satisfying four conditions: 
	- closure
	- associativity
	- the identity element
	- inverse element
### Usage in Cryptography:
- Groups provide the mathematical framework for many cryptographic systems, especially those based on the Discrete Logarithm Problem([DL](DL)), such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange and Elliptic Curve Cryptography ([ECC](ECC)).
