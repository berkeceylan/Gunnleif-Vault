One of the two medias that we used to transmit data in [Physical Layer](Physical%20Layer.md).
## Wireless Transmission:

### Definition:
- Transmission of data through the air or space without the use of physical cables or conductors.
- This form of transmission relies on electromagnetic waves to carry signals.
### Properties:
- Air, vacuum, or water can serve as the transmission medium.
- **Propagation Methods**: Include radio waves, microwaves, and infrared signals.
- Transmission and reception via antenna
	- Directional
		- Focused beam
		- Careful alignment required
		- Line-of-sight needed
	- Omnidirectional
		- Signal spreads in all directions
		- Can be received by many antennas
### Types:
### Radio Waves
- **Frequency Range**: 
	- 30 MHz to 1 GHz
- **Applications**: 
	- radio broadcasting
	- television broadcasting
	- mobile phones.
- **Advantages**: Can travel long distances and penetrate buildings, making them useful for widespread communication.
### [Microwaves](Microwaves.md)

## Pros & Cons
- **Pros**:
	- **Mobility**: Enables communication for mobile users.
	- **Ease of Installation**: Does not require physical cables; easier and faster to deploy.
	- **Reach**: Can service areas where laying cables is impractical or too expensive.
- **Cons**:
	- **Interference**: More susceptible to interference from other electromagnetic signals.
	- **Security**: More vulnerable to unauthorized access and eavesdropping.
	- **Line-of-Sight Requirement**: Particularly for microwaves and infrared, which can limit their use in certain environments.
