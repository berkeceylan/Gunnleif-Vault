## Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)
### Defintion:
- The first wide-area [Packet Switching](Packet%20Switching.md), with distributed control
- First network to implement the [TCP-IP Model](TCP-IP%20Model.md) protocol suite.

- Officially decommissioned in 1990, its technologies and most of its functions were absorbed into the emerging Internet.
## Historical Context
- **Initiation**: 
	- Developed in the late 1960s by the United States Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
- **Purpose**: 
	- Initially created for sharing resources and communication between research laboratories and universities.
- Initial Locations: 
	- UCLA, University of California at Santa Barbara, University of Utah, and Stanford Research Institute (SRI).
- Pre-1986: 
	- ARPANET use limited to ARPA contractors.
- Post-1986: 
	- NSF(National Science Foundation) sponsored extended Internet support through the NSFNET backbone
	- Connecting to ARPANET and serving the general research and education community
- NSF's backbone in the USA served as the main packet-switching network but did not allow commercial activities.
- Privatization of the Internet
	- Pre-1995: 
		- Internet subsidized by national governments.
	- Post-1995:
