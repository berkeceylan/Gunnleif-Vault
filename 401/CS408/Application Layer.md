## Definition:
- The application layer is the topmost layer in the [[OSI]] and [[TCP/IP]] models, directly interacting with software applications to implement a specific communication component or protocol.
## Properties:
- **End-User Interaction**: It provides interfaces and protocols for end-users and software applications.
- **Protocol Examples**: Includes various protocols that enable network functionality such as file transfer, email, and web browsing.
- **Service Provision**: Offers network services to end-user applications like web browsers and email clients.
- **Data Generation**: It's where network data is created, manipulated, and provided to lower layers for transmission.
## Traditional Applications:
- **[[Telnet]]**: A protocol for remote terminal access, allowing users to manage systems via a command-line interface over a network.
- **[[FTP]] (File Transfer Protocol)**: Used for the transfer of files between a client and server on a network.
- **[[Electronic Mail]] (SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: The protocol for sending and routing emails across networks.
## Modern Applications:
- **[[HTTP]] (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: The foundational protocol for the World Wide Web, enabling the retrieval of linked resources (web pages, images, etc.).
- **[[DNS]] (Internet Directory Services)**: Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, enabling applications to establish network connections using user-friendly names rather than numerical IP addresses.
- **[[Socket]]**: Endpoint for sending and receiving data across a network, allowing applications to communicate over [[TCP/IP]] by providing a standardized interface for network communication.
