- Collection of contiguous networks and hosts plus routers connected them
- Similar to [Autonomous Systems (AS)](Autonomous%20Systems%20(AS).md) but smaller version
- Make large autonomous systems more manageable
- Configured as a backbone and multiple areas
	- networks and routers that connect multiple areas as a central hub
	- Like a star topology
- Each area runs a separate copy of the link state algorithm
	- Topological database and graph of just that area
	- Link state information broadcast to other routers in area
	- Reduces traffic
	- Intra-area (within area) routing relies solely on local link state information
- **Inter-Area Routing**
	- Path consists of three legs
		- Within source area
			- Intra-area
			- Delivers to the backbone
		- Through backbone
			- Has properties of an area
			- Uses [Link-State Routing Method](Routing.md#Link-State%20Routing%20Method)
			- Delivers to the destination area
		- Within destination area
			- Intra-area
			- Delivers to recipient
