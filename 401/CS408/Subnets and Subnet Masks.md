### Subnetting:
- **Purpose**: 
	- To divide a larger network into smaller, interconnected networks called subnets.
	- Allows efficient use of an IP address range within multiple LANs in an organization.
- **Structure**
	- Each LAN in an organization is considered a subnet within a larger network class.
	- Multiple subnets appear as a single network to the external internet.
- Each subnet is given a unique number to distinguish it from others.
-  IP addresses within a subnet are split into two parts: 
	- the subnet number
	- the host number
- **Local Routing**
	- Routers are set up to direct traffic according to subnet numbers.
	- Data is routed to the intended subnet based on its unique identifier.
### Subnet Masks: 
- **Purpose**:
	- To specify which part of an IP address is the network/subnet address and which part is the host address.
- **Structure**:
	- A subnet mask contains 32 bits
		- '1s' representing the network/subnet portion
		- '0s' the host portion
		- for example, "111...111000...0".
- The number of '0s' indicates how many host addresses are available in the subnet
