## Performance Metrics

### Throughput
- Effective capacity of the data bits 
	- reduced by protocol overhead (header + control header)
### Utilization
- The ratio of the time that channel is actually used for effective data bits
- Consider 
	- idle time in channel
	- propagation time
	- overheads
	- packet switching delays
