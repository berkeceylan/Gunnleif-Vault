### Definition:
- Fourth Layer of [OSI Model](OSI%20Model.md) (Open Systems Interconnection)
- Corresponding the transport layer in [[TCP-IP Model]]
- Provides end-to end data transfer
- Shields upper layer application protocols from the details of networks
- Two types:
	- Connection Based:
		- Logical connection between end users
			- Connection Establishment
			- Data Transfer
			- Connection Termination
		- Reliable Service
	- Connectionless:
		- Unreliable
- Two main protocols:
	- [[TCP]]: 
		- Complicated flow and error control since the [Network (IP) Layer](Network%20(IP)%20Layer.md) is unreliable
		- Complex
		- Connection oriented
	- [[UDP]]:
		- Basic 
		- Connectionless
