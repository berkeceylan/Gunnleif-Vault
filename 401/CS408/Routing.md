## Routing

- Adaptive routing
    - routing decisions should change as conditions on network change
- Routing paths are change when
    - failure of [Switching](Switching.md) node
    - congestion (route around congestion)
- requires exchange of network state information
    - tradeoff: quality of information & overhead
