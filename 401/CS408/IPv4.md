### Definition:  
- One of the types of [IP](IP.md)
- Uses a 32-bit addressing scheme. 
- Most commonly used IP version
- Used by [The Internet](The%20Internet.md)
- Will be replaced by [IPv6](IPv6.md) eventually 
- Specifies protocol format and mechanisms

#### Data Field:
- User (upper layer) data
- Any octet length is OK
	- Max length of IP datagram (header + data) = 65,535  bytes (octets)
### Address Formats:
- 32 bit global Internet address
- Network part and host part
- All-zero host part = the network
- All-one host part =  broadcast 
- ![](Attachments/IPAddressFormats.png)
- **Class A**:
	- Start with binary 0
	- 7-bit network - 24-bit host
		- Few networks - many hosts
	- All zero (network and host) -> "this computer"
	- 01111111 (127) (network part ) ->  loopback
		- go all the way down and come back on the home computer
		- Generally 127.0.0.1 is used
	- Range 1.x.x.x to 126.x.x.x
		- 10.x.x.x is for private networks
	- All networks have been allocated
- **Class B**:
	- Starts with binary 10
	- Range 128.x.x.x to 191.x.x.x
		- Second octet(first x) is also part of the network id
	- 14-bit network, 16-bit host number
		- $2^{14}$ = 16,384 class B addresses
		- $2^{16} - 2$ = 65,534 hosts per network
			- Minus 2 is due to network and broadcast addresses
	- All networks have been allocated
- **Class C**:
	- Start binary 110
	- Range 192.x.x.x to 223.x.x.x
	- Second (first x) and third (second x) octets are also part of network address
		- $2^{21}$ = 2,097,152 addresses (networks)
		- $2^{56} â€“ 2$ = 254 hosts per network
		- Nearly all allocated
- **Classless Addresses**:
	- Extension of [Subnets and Subnet Masks](Subnets%20and%20Subnet%20Masks.md) idea to the whole Internet
	- Assigning IP numbers by partitioning network and host parts at any bit position
	- A precaution against exhaustion of IP addresses
	- Special notation (CIDR notation)
		- network address / number of 1-bits in the mask
		- e.g. 128.140.168.0/21
		- subnet mask is 255.255.248.0
		- Lowest host address = 128.140.168.1
		- Highest host address = 128.140.175.254
### Special IP Address Forms
| Prefix (network) | Suffix (host) | Type & Meaning |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| all zeros        | all zeros     | this computer (used during bootstrap) |
| network address  | all zeros     | identifies network |
| network address  | all ones      | broadcast on the specified network |
| all ones         | all ones      | broadcast on local network |
| 127              | any           | loopback (for testing purposes) |
