- One of the interconnection elements of [LAN](LAN.md)s
- **Definition:**
	- Designed to be implemented in software at the gateway and only process packets to/from outer networks
- **Function**: 
	- Route data packets between different networks
	- Managing traffic across LANs and WANs.
- **Operation**: 
	- Operate at the [[Network Layer]]
	- Making decisions based on IP addresses
- **Connectivity**: 
	- Enable LANs to connect to the [[Internet]] or other LANs.
- **Problem:**
	- Router may create a performance bottleneck in the heart of a LAN
		- since => Outside traffic < Internal traffic
		- High-speed LANs and high-performance layer 2 switches pump millions of packets per second
	- Solution: layer-3 Switches
		- Implement IP and the layers below (as in the router)
		- Implement packet-forwarding logic of router in hardware
			- faster
		- Types:
			- Packet by packet
			- Flow based
