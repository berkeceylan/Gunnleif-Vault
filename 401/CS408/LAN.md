## Local Area Network (LAN)
### Defintion:
### Properties:
### Topologies:
- LANs employ various topologies like bus, ring, and star, each with unique characteristics and requirements for data transmission.
- LAN Topologies:
  - **Bus Topology**: Features linear medium with terminators at each end. Stations attach via taps, allowing transmission and reception.
  - **Ring Topology**: Consists of repeaters joined by point-to-point links in a closed loop. Frames pass all stations in a circular manner.
  - **Star Topology**: Involves each station connected directly to a central node, often using a hub or switch.
