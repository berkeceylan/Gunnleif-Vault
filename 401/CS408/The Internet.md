## The Internet

### Introduction:
- **Definition**: 
	- Evolved from [ARPANET](ARPANET.md)
	- The internet is a collection of different networks that operate using [TCP-IP Model](TCP-IP%20Model.md) protocols.
- **Evolution**:
	- It evolved from ARPANET
	- First operational [Packet Switching](Packet%20Switching.md) network
	- not centrally planned or controlled.
- **Internet Host Requirements**
	- Run the [TCP-IP Model](TCP-IP%20Model.md) protocol stack.
	- Have a public/private IP address. 
	- Private IP addresses convert to public IP addresses when packets leave the local network.
- Two related topics:
	- (World Wide Web)[WWW](WWW.md)
	- [Intranets](Intranets.md)
### Key Applications
- **Remote Login**
	    - Early applications: [Telnet](Telnet.md) and rlogin (not secure).
	    - Modern application: SSH (secure).
- **File Transport Protocol ([FTP](FTP.md))**
	    - Used for transferring files from one computer to another, an early ARPANET application.
- **[Electronic Mail](Electronic%20Mail.md): The First 'Killer App'**
	    - In 1973, 75% of ARPANET's traffic was email communication.
### Internetworking
- Definition: 
	- The practice of connecting multiple networks together using gateways, bridges, and routers.
	- Subnetwork: each constituent of network
- Internet: Entire configuration
	- The Internet is the most important example of an internet
- Devices:
	- *End Systems (ESs)*: 
		- Devices at the edge of the network
		- e.g., computers and smartphones.
	- *Intermediate Systems (ISs)*: 
		- *Routers*:
			-  Devices that forward data packets between networks.
