- Same message format as 10 Mbps [Ethernet](Ethernet.md)
- **Speed**: 100 Mbps.
- Fast Ethernet may run in full duplex mode
	- So effective data rate per user becomes 200 Mbps
	- Full duplex mode requires star topology with switches
- Shared medium no longer exists when switches are used
	- no collisions -> no need to use CSMA/CD algorithm
	- However CSMA/CD still used due to backward compatibility
- **Minimum Frame Size**: 
	- The minimum frame size for Fast Ethernet (100Base-T) is 64 bytes, which is the same as traditional Ethernet.
- Cable Types:
	- 100BaseT4
		- to use voice grade cat 3 or cat 5 cables (but designed for cat 3)
		- 3 pairs in each direction with 33.3 Mbps on each using a ternary signalling scheme 
		- (8B6T = 8 bits map to 6 trits)
		- total 4 pairs (2 of them bidirectional)
	- 100Base-X
		- Unidirectional data rate of 100 Mbps
		- Uses two links (one for transmit, one for receive)
		- Two types: 100Base-TX and 100Base-FX
		- 100Base-TX
			- cat5 UTP (one pair in each direction)
			- at 125 Mhz with special encoding that has 20% overhead
				- 4 bits are encoded using 5-bit time
		- 100Base-FX
			- Optical fiber (one at each direction)
			- Similar encoding
