### Definition:
- A few routers in each AS must talk with other AS
- does not deal with details within source and target autonomous systems
	- do not consider internal routing details
- focus on the connectivity between these large network entities
### Border Gateway Protocol (BGP):
- For use with [TCP-IP Protocol](TCP-IP%20Protocol.md) internets
- Preferred ERP of the Internet
- Allows routers (gateways) in different [Autonomous Systems (AS)](Autonomous%20Systems%20(AS).md) to exchange routing information
