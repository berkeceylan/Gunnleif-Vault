# FIN406 - WEEK1&2

> Most of the time managers give more weight to extreme outcomes
> Physcalogical errors of other traders may cause the irrational decisons who normally take rational decions

## **Dual Systems**

- System1: Intuitive System
    - Fast
    - Used in most of the decisons in daily life
    - Imperfect
- System2: Deliberative System
    - Slow
    - Traditional finance based on these decisons
        - Using in each decision is very hard since it needs a lot of focus
    - Seek the perfection

> Behavioral Finance take consider both System1 and System2 ,intent to help managers and investors make better decisons

## 10 Phonemena

- **Biases**
    - *Excessive Optimisim*
        - Individuals overestimate positive outcomes and underestimate negative ones
        - Situation-specific
        - Lead individuals to underestimate risks and overlook potential negative outcomes
        - Dispositional Optimisim
            - Similar to Excessive Optimisim but is generilized verison of it
    - *Overconfidence*
        - Tendency for people to overestimate their abilities or the accuracy of their beliefs. 
        - Individuals to take on more risks with belive they are correct
    - *Confirmation Bias*
        - Individuals seek out information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs
        - Individuals ignore information that contradicts their beliefs.
    - *Illusion of Control*
        - Tendency for individuals to believe that they can control or influence outcomes
            - Even when they have no power to do so
- **Heuristics (Shortcuts)**
    - *Representativeness*
        - People judge the probability of an event by comparing it to an existing prototype in their minds
        - It can lead to errors when prototype isn't suited for the case that they used
    - *Availability*
        - Individuals base decisions on readily available information
            - from recent experiences
            - widely reported events
            - not consider the whole data
    - *Anchoring and Adjustment*
        - Individuals relying heavily on the first piece of information (the "anchor") they encounter when making decisions and adjusting their views based on that.
    - *Affect*
        - Making decisions based on emotions or feelings(Affect pool)
        - Affect Pool: 
            - the experiences that we encounter in past and labeled as good or bad
- **Framing Effect**
    - *Loss Aversion*
        - Tendency to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains
        - Psychologically, pain of losing x2 = pleasure of gaining
    - *Fourfold Pattern*
        -  risk-averse  = gains with high probabilities + losses with low probabilities
        - risk-seeking = gains with low probabilities + losses with high probabilities

> **Framing**
> Framing is a powerful cognitive tool that can shape perceptions and decisions
> The presentation of the question or case may effect the decisons of indivudulas while using shortcuts in their brain

## Prospect Theory

- **Value Function**
    - Unlike traditional utility theory, which posits that individuals derive utility directly from levels of wealth, Prospect Theory argues that people derive value from changes in wealth relative to a reference point, which is typically their current wealth. 
    - The value function is S-shaped and asymmetrical:
        - *Loss Aversion*
            - Losses hurt more than gains give pleasure
            -  same amont certain loss feels worse than a gain of the same amount feels good
        - *Diminishing Sensitivity*
            - The value function is concave for gains and convex for losses.
            - Gains or losses grow in size, the pain or pleasure derived from them decreases

- **Probability Weighting**
    - People tend to overweight small probabilities and underweight large probabilities
- **Framing**: 
    - Decisions are influenced by how they are framed
    - In terms of gains and losses. 
    - Related with loss averison
- **Fourfold Pattern of Risk Preferences**
    - *Low probability gains*:
        - People are risk-seeking 
        - e.g., buying a lottery ticket
    - *High probability gains*:
        - People are risk-averse 
        - e.g., accepting a sure win over a gamble with a higher expected value
    - *Low probability losses*:
        - People are risk-averse 
        - e.g., buying insurance
    - *High probability losses*:
        - People are risk-seeking 
        - e.g., opting to gamble rather than accepting a certain loss

## SP/A Theory

- Consider indidual based decisions
- Psychological theory of risk taking focused on 
    - Security to address fear
    - Potential to address hope
    - The need for success in respect to Aspiration 
- Fear leads to the overweighting of rare unfavorable events
- Hope leads to the overweighting of rare favorable events.
- **Aspiration Points**
    - The theory emphasizes that while gains and losses can be defined relative to one reference point
    - Individual might also aspire to achieve a different reference point
        -  It is ausually higher point (Aspiration point)
        - This aspiration point separates success from failure, as opposed to gain from loss. 

## March-Sapira Framework

- Consider firm based decisions
- 	For a non-distressed firm, the theory postulates that when a firm is operating below aspiration
    - experiencing a shortfall
    - it takes on relatively high risk
    - as the shortfall shrinks the amount of risk declines
- When the shortfall turns into a surplus
    - risk falls discontinuously at the juncture
    - but then increases with the magnitude of the surplus. 
- **Focal Points**
    - Distressed firm takes low risk
    - If the distresss declines the risk taking behavious increase
- Distress (decrease) = risk taking (increase)

> Increase in the testeosterone and decrease in cortisol may led people to taking more risky decisions

> **Nudge**
> Nudge is about how the decisions framed to peoples and how this framing effect their decisions in a good or bad way
> *Using Nudge in a positive may mitigate the pitfalls*
